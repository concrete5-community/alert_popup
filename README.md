# Alert Popup

Alert Popup is a ConcreteCMS/concrete5 package that allows you to display rich text in a modal dialog.

The dialog can be opened by a button or a link (you can specify text or an image for them), as well as via a very simple JavaScript line.

You can control these aspects of the modal:

- width and minimum/maximum width
- height and minimum/maximum height
- border size and color
- backdrop color and opacity
- option to animate the modal when it opens and closes

The content of the dialog is rich text.

You can preview how the dialog will appear while you edit the block (you don't have to edit the block, save it, and save the page in order to check how it will appear).
